# Diabetes-Prediction-using-SVM

This repository consists of 3 files:
1. "code_file" consists of train and test code for the ML model used. Then, save it using pickle package.
2. "Web_App" and ".html" files are used to create web interface(using Flask) for the saved model. 

IDE: jupyter notebook / Pycharm 

Packages: Scikit-learn, Flask, Pickle

Machine Learning model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Output: Diabetic, Non-Diabetic

dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set

```
Accuracy on train dataset:  78.33%
Accuracy on test dataset: 72.7%
